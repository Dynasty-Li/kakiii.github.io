### Hello my buddies

Although I haven't got any information about you, I still love to write a letter to all of you.

Let me first offer my congratulations to all of you for being admitted to this unique University and thanks for choosing and trusting us.

I think it's the first time for most of you to step on this seemingly mysterious eastern country and it's a great chance for me to make acquaintance with you guys at least. Maybe you are rather confused about what your life will be like here. I will tell something that won't be mentioned in the handbook.

Before you come to China, remember to install a VPN application to use your local social media and service. From my perspective, building an SSR server is the most economical option but it could be very demanding so I choose to rent others. In China, there is a Great FireWall (GFW), constructed and maintained by the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. The main function is blocking foreign websites, such as Google, Reddit, Twitch and most foreign media in Chinese.

Certainly, you may ask "Why?" after I introduce or you aren't interested in this, so I will just conclude to the only sentence:  It protects most Chinese people and maintain the stability of the government because the revolution fruit was really really hard to get. It's a big and sensitive topic. If you are interested, we will talk about it after arriving in XJTLU.

Although there is no requirement about the Chinese language when you apply for this university, you still have to learn a bit to live your daily life, don't you? I believe there are some simple sentences and pronunciation about food or something else, but obviously, it is far from enough. I can teach you some if you want. I don't remember who said the words that a person learned in a foreign language are always "Hello" "Goodbye" "Thank you" in first and "f\*\*k you" "d\*\*n it" in second, and so are the Chinese. Do you agree? HahaðŸ˜‚

Please forgive me for my poor grammar. Actually, I am only a bit good at academic English, which I have learned from primary school to now, and this is the most common situation for Chinese students. They cannot understand the daily slang or punch line. All they can is working out problems in many types: Multiple choice questions, reading, listening, writing(in fact still very poor), which is called as "Dumb English". If so, they will face great challenges in XJTLU.

Luckily I did not encounter that kind of situation. I am a completely local student. I moved to Suzhou at such a young age, when I could barely remember anything. My primary school, middle school, high school are all located in Suzhou Industrial Park (SIP), the most modern region of Suzhou. Consequently, I received relatively good education and many Internet resources, which are very helpful for my English study.

My home and XJTLU are just sepearated by a street, so I can say that I am more familiar with this area than most of my schoolmates. In the coming induction week in the late August, there will also be some activities prepared by our volunteers (me included) to help you better get used to this.

My hobbies can be found in my CV I believe, so if you like playing online games, you can add [my steam account](http://s.team/p/cmwj-vwgw/PQNWVRPC). If it expires, please inform me of this by email or any other venue. I am also willing to learn foreign languages, and if you can speak spanish it is the best because I learned that in my Year 1 Semester 1 and I found it really interesting and not so difficult, while other languages are good as well.

There are many interesting places in Suzhou, for its culture which you are unfamiliar with. If you like, I can drive you around to introduce those for you.
I got my driving license last year, which is very early compared with my classmates.

I think that's all I want to tell you guys.

The last point: if you think my name hard to pronunce (çŽ‹å˜‰å¥‡, Wang Jiaqi, you can read it like Wan Zhia Chi ), just call me KaKi, which you can see in every page of my blog.

See you in XJTLU!!

Kaki Wang
